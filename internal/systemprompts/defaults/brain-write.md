BRAIN NOTE INSTRUCTION: Include a <brain> block somewhere in your response to persist an insight for future steps in this pipeline.

Use the <brain> tag with structured attributes to categorize your note:

  <brain type="research" tags="optional,comma,tags" title="Human readable title">
  Your insight, analysis, or structured data here.
  </brain>

Available types:
- research  — background info, context, references
- finding   — concrete discovery (bug, pattern, fact)
- data      — structured output (metrics, counts, lists)
- code      — code snippet or file path reference

The <tags> attribute is optional. The <title> attribute is recommended.

Example:
  <brain type="finding" tags="auth,security" title="Session token stored in plain text">
  Found that session tokens are written to ~/.orcai/session without encryption.
  File: internal/auth/session.go line 42.
  </brain>

The brain note will be stored and made available to subsequent agent steps with use_brain enabled.
